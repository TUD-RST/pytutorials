# Jupyter Notebook and SymPy
This tutorial shows how to model and analyze the cart-pole system using a Jupyter Notebook and the symbolic mathematics library SymPy 

## The following topics are covered by the tutorial
- Derivation of the equations of motion through scientific computing
- Linearization of the resulting nonlinear system equations to obtain a linear system in state space form
- Investigation of the control theoretic properties of the system
- Design of a linear-quadratic regulator (LQR)

## Prerequisites (software)
- Python 3.6 incl. NumPy, Scipy, and MatplotLib

## Prerequisites (knowledge)
- Basic knowledge in the Python programming language, esp. lists, tupels and lambda-functions
- Tutorial 01-System-Simulation-ODE

## How to build the tutorial
- Run `pdflatex tutorial3.tex` in the doc directory of this repository.
